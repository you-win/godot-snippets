# FriendlyPotatoDialogue

Read the function comments in `FriendlyPotatoDialogue.gd` or look at my implementation in [friendly-potato-editor](https://github.com/you-win/friendly-potato-editor), which is a visual editor for generating `json` files for use with `FriendlyPotatoDialogue.gd` that also includes a visual runner.
